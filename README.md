### Bikeshare Project


### Description
The bikeshare project is used to pull data on specific statistics from large csv files that are based on three cities which are Washington, New York City, and Chicago. The project focuses on using pandas library usage and allows the user to input their selections of what city, month, and day as the code provides an inetractive experience with the user. Each csv file contains the same six columns and the code computes a variety of descriptive statistics for popular times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip duration, and user information regarding bikeshare in each city.
